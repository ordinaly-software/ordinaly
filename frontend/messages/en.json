          "q": "What is an AI agent for business and how can it help my company?",
          "a": "An AI agent is an intelligent system that can perform specific tasks autonomously, such as answering customer inquiries, processing documents, managing appointments, or automating workflows.",
          "extra": "For your business in Seville, this means time savings, reduction of human errors, and 24/7 availability. For example, a property manager can have an agent that automatically manages community incidents via WhatsApp."

        "1": {
          "q": "How much does it cost to implement AI automation in my company?",
          "a": "The cost varies depending on project complexity. Simple projects like WhatsApp chatbots or basic automations can start with budgets accessible to SMEs.",
          "extra": "We offer free consultations where we analyze your specific case and provide a personalized quote. Most of our clients recover their investment in less than 6 months thanks to time and resource savings."
        },
        "2": {
          "q": "Do I need technical knowledge to use automation systems?",
          "a": "Not at all. We design all our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Plus, we include practical training for your team.",
          "extra": "We also offer AI courses in Seville where you'll learn to use tools like ChatGPT, automations and more, without any prior programming knowledge."
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "What sets Ordinaly apart from other automation companies?",
          "a": "We are a local team in Seville that understands the specific needs of Andalusian companies. We are not an international consultancy that applies generic solutions.",
          "extra": "We specialize in SMEs and specific sectors (real estate, property managers, marketing, retail) and combine automation with practical training so your team becomes self-sufficient."
        },
        "4": {
          "q": "How long does it take to implement an automation project?",
          "a": "Simple projects like chatbots or basic automations can be running in 2-4 weeks.",
          "extra": "More complex projects like CRM/ERP implementation with Odoo or advanced workflows can take between 1-3 months, depending on scope. We always work in phases so you see quick results."
        },
        "5": {
          "q": "Do you offer support after implementation?",
          "a": "Yes, of course. We include technical support and maintenance. Being based in Seville, we can have in-person meetings when needed.",
          "extra": "Additionally, our systems are scalable: as your business grows, we can expand and improve automations without starting from scratch."
